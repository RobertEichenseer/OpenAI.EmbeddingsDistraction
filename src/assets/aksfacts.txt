Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is a managed Kubernetes service that simplifies deploying and operating containerized applications in Azure. Some of the top features of AKS are: It integrates with various Azure services, such as load balancing, blob storage, and managed databases, to provide a seamless and scalable cloud-native experience. It offers a hosted control plane that is free of charge and handles critical tasks like health monitoring and maintenance. It supports easy and secure containerized applications management with features like Azure Active Directory integration, role-based access control, and Microsoft Defender for Containers. It enables flexible deployment options from the cloud to the edge with Azure Arc, which allows you to run AKS on your own infrastructure and manage it with the same tools and policies as in Azure.
